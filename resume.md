**Limeade**

Associate Platform Developer

Bellevue, Washington. March 2016 - January 2017.

Identified pain points, outdated technology, and inefficient functionality in the internal support stack. Gathered requirements and created resolution plans, then implemented them. This work achieved a significant reduction in support triage times, time-to-resolution, and escalation counts.

Designed and implemented new support-oriented features across the platform stack by way of new APIs, web applications, platform-based functionality, more efficient backend services, and SQL stored procedures. Developed API/design documentation and technical support documents for this work.

Dramatically increased unit and functional test coverage throughout the support stack.

Platform Developer Intern.

Bellevue, Washington. June 2015 - March 2016.

Created a full-stack utility for the Limeade data cache, built on top of a REST API and a C#/.NET backend, interacting with the cache. Enables the user to manually invalidate cached items via selection, searches, or metadata.

Developed a React-based frontend for a service that checks templates for syntax, spelling, and content issues. Built with a UX and accessibility emphasis, as this tool was for internal non-technical teams. Parses a JSON result from the backend validation service into a friendly overview of potential issues and common solutions.

Designed and developed an application that enables the dynamic configuration of certain deployment settings in the Limeade platform, allowing it to be more environment-agnostic. Built as a React client on top of a C#/.NET backend.
